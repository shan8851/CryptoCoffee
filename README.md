# CryptoCoffee ☕️

Hey there! I'm Shan, a software engineer and mentor who loves to share knowledge about React, Typescript, and all things crypto over a good cup of coffee. CryptoCoffee is a way for my mentees or anybody who finds my content useful to give back.

## What's Brewing?

CryptoCoffee is a personal thank you platform for the content and mentoring I provide. If you've found my guidance helpful or enjoyed my contributions to the tech community, you can 'buy me a coffee' using Ethereum. It's a crypto-twist to the classic gesture of appreciation.

### Why Coffee?

Coffee chats are a staple of my mentoring sessions, and nothing beats a heartfelt discussion over a steaming brew. So, why not make it virtual and allow the crypto to add a bit of flavour?

## Pouring a Coffee

To send a coffee my way:

1. Connect your Ethereum wallet.
2. Enter an amount in USD.
3. Make the transaction and share the warmth.

Simple as that!

## The Tech Stack Behind the Mug

- **Front-End**: My go to React, NextJS and Typescript.
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity's my go-to for secure Ethereum transactions.

## ₿ Bitcoin Maxis?

More of a Bitcoin fan? No problem! You can also show your support by donating Bitcoin directly to my wallet:
